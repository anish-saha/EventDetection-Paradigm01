# Paradigm: Event Detection 
### DATA-X SPR19 Final Project


Utilized various methodoligies and baseline definitions to identify events (significant price changes) throughout the volatile history of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. <br>

The Isolation Forest anomaly detection algorithm, the ARIMA statistical analysis algorithm, and the cluster-then-predict methologies involving t-SNE and K-Means were comparatively analyzed in the context of this unsupervised learning task. Please view the final report for an in-depth information analysis on this project.
